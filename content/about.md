## Hello, I'm Kristin Cowalcijk.

I am a programmer working on infrastructures and tools for spatial
datascience. You can find me writing proprietary code for my company in day
time, and contributing to open source projects at night. I'd really like to have
a full time paid job working on open source projects, contact me if there're such 
job opportunities available :-)

Currently I am a Java/Scala programmer and I am working with lots of Apache
projects related to big data and distributed computing. I am also good at writing
native code, I wrote lots of C++ code and I've put years of love and hate to this
programming language. I'll try out Rust when I have to do some system programming
in the future.

## Personal Life

I have lived with girlfriend "Kitanai" for more than 5 years. She is a
transgender and currently we have no plan for SRS yet. We decided to live a
life without marriage and children. She gave me lots of guidance on life styles
and helped me making lots of important decisions (moving to new jobs, etc.).

## Hobbies

I like playing video games. I have more than 100 video games in my Steam
library and most of them are indie games. I love listening to indie music, my
favorite genres are fusion, post-rock and progressive-rock.

I'm a little bit into "Otaku" culture (anime, manga, etc.). Except for new
shows such as "POP TEAM EPIC 2", I'm currently watching classic Gundam series
["Z"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Zeta_Gundam) and
["ZZ"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_ZZ).
